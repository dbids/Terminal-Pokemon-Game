Things to Note:

If it is useful the non-extra credit version of my code can be found here: https://github.com/EC327-Fall2019/pa4-dbids/commit/450b309c605e12c50400872ba1dc176e20cdae43.  Note that I it works 100% as well as the finished product, but I thought that this may be useful to you.

Extra Credit:
  	1) I did the first extra credit for saving and loading functions.  Note that this was done to C++11 ( I used stoi, stod, stoul).
	The file save.txt is included which is a sample of a properly saved game.  This is done using S save.txt in the game, and 
	loading is similarly achieved using R save.txt;
	2) I also did the second extra credit where I added moves to the battle.  This resulted in me changing the TakeHit
	function so if you with to see that then the old version is commented out below it.  This also involved implementing another class
	called Attack_Types which handles the storage and choice of different attack types throughout the game.
	3) I did the final extra credit option as well which was open ended. For this I used online ASCII art and added it to the game 
	to hype up the battles!  This means that I added a function to printPokemon within the Pokemon and Rival class and used it 
	to print them at the start of the game and during battles.
